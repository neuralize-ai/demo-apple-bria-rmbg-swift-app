## Demo

This is a Swift demo app that runs the BriaRMBG-1.4 model.

To run this app, you first need to have the CoreML model. 
Go to this [repo](https://github.com/neuralize-ai/demo-apple-bria-rmbg) to convert the PyTorch model to CoreML model.

Once you have the CoreML file (`.mlpackage` file), simply drag it into the XCode project.
